## INFOTC 4500 JOURN 4444 Team-Based Mobile Device Application Development

### Syllabus (FS18, v1.0)

The goal of this course is to provide students with the skills to design and develop software applications for mobile devices in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment. The students engaged in software development will learn the development tools, languages, and SDKs. The students engaged in design will learn how to design, prototype, and assess applications for mobile devices. Both groups of students will learn how to communicate with each other and work together to create mobile applications.

The target platform is the latest version of Apple iOS on iPhones and iPads.  Xcode is used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Swift is the target programming language.  The software development, because of the target platform and the available tools, must be on an Apple Mac running OS X.  The developers are provided with MacBook Pros for the semester if they don’t have their own.

**JOURN 4444 Professional Competencies**

Students in this course can expect to develop a wide range of knowledge and skills highly relevant to entrepreneurial work in media and technology, including the following professional competencies:

  * Think critically, creatively and independently;
  * Collaborate with others in a professional manner across diverse disciplines;
  * Conduct research and evaluate information using methods that relate both to journalistic inquiry and also to audience development and digital product design;
  * Apply current tools and technologies that relate to a wide range of communications professions and audience/user needs;
  * Understand the digital world and how mobile apps can help address the needs of individuals and societies.

Do not indicate after the fact that you forgot to sign the sign-in sheet.  You are responsible for signing the sheet during the class you are attending.

Excused Absences

For the purpose of reporting absences and getting approval for an excused absence contact: 
•	Dale Musser – musserda@missouri.edu - if you are a developer in INFOTC 4500.
•	James Gordon – gordonj@rjionline.org - if you are a designer in JOURN 4444.

Attendance at class meetings is required and expected. The following are valid reasons for missing a class meeting:
•	A medical emergency.
•	A funeral.
•	A job interview.
•	Attendance at a conference.
•	A recognized religious holiday
•	A trip to the International Space Station.

In the case of a job interview, attendance at a conference, a recognized religious holiday, or a visit to the space station you must discuss missing class with the instructor BEFORE the event.

Do not come to the instructor after the fact and say you missed class because of an interview, conference, holiday, or due to space travel. Obtain an email from the instructor indicating the absence will be excused before the day is missed. If your absence is excused you will not be given credit for, nor will you lose credit for, the day you were absent. The missed day will not be used in the calculation.

Missed exams or in-class activities/assignments may be made up only if the absence is excused based on the criteria provided above.

#### Instructional Strategies

This course uses Challenge Based Learning as its primary instructional strategy. How Challenge Based Learning works is covered in class.

#### Assignments

All assignments (quizzes, exams, activities, challenges, and projects) must be completed by the due date/time to receive credit.

You must fulfill the requirements of an assignment submission to receive credit for that assignment. Any information you are asked to provide and files you are asked to supply must be present to receive credit for the assignment.  If you are asked to follow a specific procedure or utilize a convention you must do so to receive credit.  For example, if you are asked to name a project in a specific way and you do not follow the rules provided you will receive a zero on the assignment.  If you are unsure of what you are to do you must ask and receive clarification before submitting your work.

#### Required Textbooks

#### Hardware/Software Requirements

The software developers are required to use an Apple macOS computer that has the latest version of Xcode installed. If you have a Mac that can run the latest version of Xcode, you may use it.  If you are one of the software developers and do not have a Mac, a Macbook Pro will be provided for your use.  **Developers are required to keep OS X and Xcode on their Macbooks up-to-date.**

The designers are expected to become familiar with the iOS design paradigm, which will be easier if they have access (at least intermittently) to an iOS device, preferably an iPhone, running the latest version of the iOS operating system. Notify your instructor if this is an issue. Additionally, designers will need access to basic design software such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, etc. These programs are available in several labs on campus as well as computers in the Journalism library. For students who choose to acquire this software for use on their own laptops, note that student discounts are available.  There will be additional design tools that will be required and will be discussed with the designers in class.

You do not need an iOS device to test applications, but it can be very helpful.

#### Accounts

You need to have an Apple ID and a GitHub account.

*Apple ID*

The Apple ID (account) is used with Xcode to test applications on devices. Any Apple ID you may have previously created will work. If you already have an Apple ID for iTunes, Apple Music, iBooks, etc then you have the account you need. If you don’t have an Apple account you can create one at: <https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create>

*GitHub Account*

You are to use GitHub with this course. If you already have a GitHub account then you can use it.

#### Grading

*INFOTC 4500 Grading Criteria*

Consistent with the professional project-based nature of this course, final grades for software developers will be based on overall performance throughout the semester, similar to the way professional employees working as software engineers are evaluated in performance reviews.

The components of the evaluation include:

  * **Attitude and Behavior** – interaction with others, positive attitude, helps solve problems rather than creating them, results oriented, interacts well with others.
  * **Competence** – technical skills, knowledge of programming language and development tools, knowledge of APIs, ability to use knowledge and skills to create software.
  * **Communication** – clear, correct, and timely communication.
  * **Contribution and Productivity** – demonstrates an ongoing ability to deliver results and make significant contributions to projects and other activities.
  * **Engagement** – participates in activities and projects with enthusiasm.
  * **Initiative** – does not wait to be told what to do. Determines what needs to be done and then engages in activities to accomplish the desired outcome.  Engages in independent learning and investigation.  Is proactive rather than reactive.
  * **Organization and Management** – is organized and demonstrates management abilities. This includes the proper use of version control and project management software as well as keeping software updated.  Management also includes demonstrating leadership ability.
  * **Professional Etiquette** – respect for others, consistently and punctually attends class and meetings, and presents themselves well.
  * **Teamwork** – is collaborative and supportive. Is a positive, contributing member of the team.

Evidence of these components will be collected throughout the semester and are used in making a professional judgment of performance by the instructors.  This evidence is collected through assessments (code reviews, demonstrations, tests, attendance), observations, feedback from others (teammates, instructors, learning assistants, other students), and self-reflection.

Below are the overarching outcomes related to different grade levels based on the above components. Plus/minus grades may be assigned as merited.

[ A ] – You consistently perform at the highest levels. You are a model student for everyone else in the course.

[ B ] - You go above and beyond basic expectations. Overall the work demonstrates some characteristics of an A grade but is not quite at the level of "model student."

[ C ] – You meet a minimal expectation.

[ D ] – There are issues regarding your abilities, contribution, and engagement with meeting the expectations.

[ F ] — Even the most basic expectations of abilities, contribution, and engagement have not been demonstrated.

*JOURN 4444 Grading Criteria*

Consistent with the professional project-based nature of this course, final grades for designers will be based on overall performance throughout the semester, similar to the way professional employees are evaluated in annual performance reviews. Along the way you will receive ongoing coaching and will have multiple individual meetings with your instructor to discuss your work and get feedback to help guide you toward peak performance. Students also have a chance to weigh in on the final evaluation of performance.

Also factored in will be attendance and class participation along with work on specific individual assignments including homework, quizzes, etc.

Below are the overarching outcomes related to different grade levels. Plus/minus grades may be assigned as merited.

[ A ] — You consistently take initiative and your work regularly goes above and beyond what is expected. You gain mastery of material in assigned readings (and complete the readings when they are due). You incorporate finer details from those readings into class discussions and into your work. You pay attention in class and both actively listen and actively contribute during class discussions and team meetings. You pay attention to feedback and use it as a basis for refining and improving your work. Your project outcomes are built upon solid research and you clearly articulate sound reasoning for decisions made along the way. You collaborate well with your teammates; i.e., you take the work seriously and make a significant individual contribution to the project, while also sharing responsibility and ownership of the outcomes. You consider the perspective and expertise of others and behave respectfully toward those around you. You consistently bring enthusiasm and a positive attitude, and you put honest effort into all aspects of your work. In short, you are a model student for everyone else in the course.

[ B ] — You go above and beyond basic expectations. Your work is generally free of problems and aligns with the core teachings. You demonstrate some familiarity with material from assigned readings and incorporate at least some aspects of the material into your work. You generally participate in class discussions and make a significant individual contribution to the project. Final outcomes are good but might not be fully reasoned. Overall the work demonstrates some characteristics of an A grade but is not quite at the level of "model student."

[ C ] — The work meets the basic requirements of the course. You show up to class regularly and deliver a final product but with some bumps along the way. Material from readings and class discussion is applied, but minimally. Individual contribution to project is apparent but does not go significantly above the minimum. Participation in class discussion is limited and/or student is regularly unprepared or distracted during class time. Project decisions are made arbitrarily rather than based on research, readings and/or other methods of sound reasoning. Teammates may report some difficulties in counting on you, but you generally contribute a passing amount of effort toward the project.

[ D ] — Although you delivered something that reflects the overall requirements, the quality of the work is below what is expected for this course. Most or all of the characteristics described in the grade levels above do not apply to your work and/or team members have not been able to rely on you to pull your weight in relation to the project.

[ F ] — The basic work required for this course has not been delivered.

#### Academic Honesty

Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor.

#### Intellectual Property Notice

All course materials including but not limited to the syllabus, course assignments, study guides, learning guides, online lecture videos and content, and lab book (i.e. course pack) are property of the instructor and University and may not be shared online or distributed in any manner to others. Students are prohibited from posting course materials or notes online and from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Violations of copyright laws could subject you to civil penalties and criminal liability. Violations of academic integrity may subject you to disciplinary action under University policies.

#### Classroom Misconduct

Classroom misconduct is defined by the University of Missouri’s collected rules and regulations are also outlined in the M-Book Student Code of Conduct.

See:  
<https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct>  
<https://accountability.missouri.edu/university-policies/>

Classroom misconduct includes forgery of class attendance; obstruction or disruption of teaching, including late arrival or early departure; failure to turn off cellular telephones leading to disruption of teaching; playing games or surfing the Internet on laptop computers unless instructed to do so; harassment, bullying, physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.       

IMPORTANT: Entering a classroom late or leaving a classroom before the end of the period can be extremely disruptive behavior. Students are asked to arrive for class on time and to avoid early departures. Instructors have the right to deny students access to the classroom if they arrive late and have the right to dismiss a student from the class for early departures that result in disruptions.                 

Under MU policy, your instructor has the right to ask for your removal from the course for misconduct, disruptive behavior or excessive absences. The instructor then has the right to issue a grade of withdraw, withdraw failing or F. The instructor alone is responsible for assigning the grade in such circumstances.

#### Dishonesty and Misconduct Reporting Procedures

MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Allegations of academic misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Office of the Provost.
